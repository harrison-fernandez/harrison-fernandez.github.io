    Hello! Welcome to my site, I am currently an undergraduate student. <br> I am expecting to graduate in May 2019.<br> I look forward to attending a PhD program in Computer Science <br> with a focus on computer and network security in Fall 2019. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I am excited about where research may take me, and at this time I have significant <br> knowledge and skills related to the security of IoT devices, binary analysis, <br> code cloning, Bitcoin and Ethereum, fuzz testing, and Android applications. <br> <br> I am very passionate about the quality of elementary and higher education, <br> economic and social inequality and injustice, and how computer science and <br> technology can improve these broad topics.
    <br>
    <br>
    Coming from a low-income household and personal hardships, I strive everyday <br> to make my parents and extended family proud: by doing what I love, lifting up and <br> motivating the people around me, serving as a role model and mentor to those who have <br> faced similar hardships and experiences, and being the first in my family to pursue a PhD.
