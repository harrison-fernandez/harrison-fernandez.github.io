    <!--Bio-->Hello and welcome to my site! I am currently an undergraduate student, expecting to graduate in May 2019. I look forward to attending a PhD program in Computer Science with a focus on computer and network security in Fall 2019. 
    <br><br>I am excited about where research may take me, and at this time I have significant knowledge and skills related to the security of IoT devices, binary analysis, code cloning, Bitcoin and Ethereum, fuzz testing, and Android applications. I am very passionate about the quality of elementary and higher education, economic and social inequality and injustice, and how computer science and technology can improve these important issues for future generations.
    <br><br>Coming from a low-income household and my own hardships, I strive everyday to make my family proud. I do this by pursuing what I love: research, teaching, and mentoring. I am most proud of being able to motivate and lift up the people around me, serving as a role model to those who have faced similar experiences, and being the first in my family to pursue a PhD.
